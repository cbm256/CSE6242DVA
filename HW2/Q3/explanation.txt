A.2:
Features 2 (plasma glucose) vs. Feature 5 (insulin) is the better feature. 
Because on the second graph most points are overlapping each other.
However, on the first graph, although there are some overlaps, most of the negative points are on the smaller parts of plasma glucose while positive the opposite. 

C:
if data is in a very big range, we may use square root scale and log scale in charts because they can scale data to a smaller range and better reflect the relation among data.
